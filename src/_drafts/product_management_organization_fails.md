title:  "Product Manager Organization Fails"
categories: agile product
---
One of the things that most processes based in agile agree on is that there should be one person in charge of the product that that the team is building and that they should be on the team. Being in charge doesn't mean they should not listen to others on the team but it does mean that they should have the final say on what is valuable for the customers. This requires that the person in this role is in regular conversation with customers(if you have a SaaS product there is no reason that the Product Manager shouldn't be able to talk to actual customers). Also, it requires that the person in question be on the team and to work in collaboration with the rest of the team. Finally, this person needs the support of the company to not be constantly countermanded and to be able to take accountability for their choices both good and bad.

One of the common ways that organizations do this wrong is by trying to split the Product Manager role over multiple people. This can take several forms:

- The Product by Committee
- The Product/Project Management Split
- The Absent Product Manager

Each of these is problematic for different reasons and will cause unhappiness, a worse product, longer time to market, and often outright failure. Before I go over each of them I want to remind you that a key role of the Product Manager is to work with the team and customers to figure out the most valuable features to build or enhance in the software and to work with the team to get value to the customers as quickly as possible. Often these are also symptoms of a top down organization and thus the team has no power to adjust itself to adopt a more effective team structure.

##Product by Committee
The first of these negative forms to discuss is the Product by Committee. This often happens when either the organization is unclear about roles or is afraid to trust a single person to have the final say on steering a given product. The result of this form will predictable to anyone that has tried to design something by committee. Constant churn as the Product Managers go off on different visions of the solution and engineering confusing as one Product Manager gives the engineers different answers than the other. This form often falls to paralysis and bickering. Even if the team successfully delivers to market the customers will be confused by the incoherent mess of the features delivered.

##The Product/Project Management Split
This form is where the organization tries to divide the Product Manager into two roles. The one that communicates with the engineers and the rest of the team(The Project Manager) and the one that figures out what features to build(The Product Manager). One of the major problems of this form is the explicit disdain of the person that figures out what to build to waste their time talking to engineers. This leads to the team feeling disenfranchised and often a drop in quality and high turnover. Additionally, this organizational form increases the effort required for the team to communicate things that they learn back to the person figuring out the features. Further, this form's "person that talks to the engineers" is generally an unfulfilling and disempowering job that often results in either high turnover or people that just show up and do as little as possible. Due to this form there is often an aspect of telephone game issues as all communication of value about the product with the engineers is done through an intermediary. This only enhances the divide between product and engineering. Lastly, in this form engineers are typically forced to stay in their role box unable to directly get customer feedback or contribute to product decisions or solution definition.

##The Absent Product Manager
This form is caused by the Product Manager having multiple jobs in the organization whether it is being the Product Manager for multiple teams or doing some other job unrelated to the product they own. This leads to to teams that are either constantly slowed down waiting to hear back from the Product Manager or that make guesses constantly instead of asking questions. This leads to mistrust as the Product Manager feels the team is not building what they expected and the rest of the team feels the Product Manager is not helping them. This also often leads to slow feedback cycles as the Product Manager is too busy to regularly look at the software the team is building and thus tends to do so only after significant pieces have been built. This only magnifies the pain when the Product Manager realizes the team has not built what they expected. 

Often because the Product Manager does not have time to collaborate with the team they are forced to either give only vague information to the team and relinquish most of their responsibilities to them or to engage in waterfall like descriptions of the features expecting the team to deliver on exactly what is specified. This leads to more disenfranchisement, distrust, and unhappy customers as the team fails to deliver valuable features and take into account customer feedback.

##The Way Forward
Many of the pitfalls enumerated above are avoided by having a single person that is the Product Manager. However, it is important that this person not only does their job but works closely with the rest of the team to collaborate on the best solutions. This increases trust and allows the team to feel more ownership which leads to increased satisfaction with work and better products.
