title:  "Product Manager Organization Fails"
categories: agile product
---
One of the major responsibilites in any organization that creates and sells their own product(s) is deciding just what that product is, validating that customers want and will pay for it, and grooming the products features through out its lifespan. This is commonly known as Product Management. Sometimes these responsibilities are distrubted over every member of the team. However, in many situations teams will include one or more persons that are largely dedicated to Product Management.

Some software development processes have specific names for the role that will, to varying degrees, perform these reponsibilities. eXtreme Programming with its origin in consulting and internal software projects referes to this person as the Customer. Scrum calls them the Product Owner. Many organization simple refere to them as Product Managers. The discipline of Product Managements dates back to the 1930s with its [origin](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) in advertising and brand management. However, it moved in to tech fairly shortly after.

Often a major selling point of making product development in an organization Agile is the claim that they will produce more value faster for customers. Sadly, this often is actually interpreted as Agile resulting in devlopment happening faster, i.e. more features faster. In reality, many Agile teams will slow down as the spend more time figuring out what will be valuable for the customers and making stragecic investments in those features. This produces fewer features in the same time but at a significantly higher level of average value and the team learns much more about the customer in addition. This misconception could be the topic of its own article but is important for this dicussion because it sends teams and the organization down the path of becoming a [Feature Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2).

Being a Feature Factory is devistating for the success of any Agile adoption as it ultimately results in doing Waterfall via Agile where the organization still does huge projects but via stories and Scrums. This leaves out one of the major purposes of Agile which is adjusting to feedback since it still realys on central planning and design of projects upfront. It can provide value to the organization if done carefully because of increased visiability and the production of software that can be looked at prior to the end of the project. However, while this approach often reduces risk of [never delivering the software](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails) because it forces the organization to deal with many of the most common reasons for failure near the begining of the project it does nothing to help increase the chances the software is actually valuable to customers. 

Big upfront planned projects in addition to have signifcant customer value risk also suffer 

----------------------------------------------

One of the things that most processes based in agile agree on is that there should be one person in charge of the product that that the team is building and that they should be on the team. Being in charge doesn't mean they should not listen to others on the team but it does mean that they should have the final say on what is valuable for the customers. This requires that the person in this role is in regular conversation with customers(if you have a SaaS product there is no reason that the Product Manager shouldn't be able to talk to actual customers). Also, it requires that the person in question be on the team and to work in collaboration with the rest of the team. Finally, this person needs the support of the company to not be constantly countermanded and to be able to take accountability for their choices both good and bad.

One of the common ways that organizations do this wrong is by not having Product Management be a function of the team or a member of it. This can take several different forms:

- The Product by Committee
- The Product/Project Management Split
- The Absent Product Manager

Each of these is problematic for different reasons and will cause unhappiness for the team, a worse product for the customer, longer time to market, and often outright failure deliver a succesful product. Before I go over each of them I want to remind you that a key role of the Product Manager is to work with the team and customers to figure out the most valuable features to build or enhance in the software and to work with the team to get value to the customers as quickly as possible. Often these are also symptoms of a top down organization and thus the team has no power to adjust itself to adopt a more effective team structure.

## Product by Committee

The first of these negative forms to discuss is the Product by Committee. This often happens when either the organization is unclear about roles or is afraid to trust a single person to have the final say on steering a given product. The result of this form will predictable to anyone that has tried to design something by committee. Constant churn as the Product Managers go off on different visions of the solution and engineering confusing as one Product Manager gives the engineers different answers than the other. This form often falls to paralysis and bickering. Even if the team successfully delivers to market the customers will be confused by the incoherent mess of the features delivered.

## The Product/Project Management Split

This form is where the organization tries to divide the Product Manager into two roles. The one that communicates with the engineers and the rest of the team(The Project Manager) and the one that figures out what features to build(The Product Manager). One of the major problems of this form is the explicit disdain of the person that figures out what to build to waste their time talking to engineers. This leads to the team feeling disenfranchised and often a drop in quality and high turnover. Additionally, this organizational form increases the effort required for the team to communicate things that they learn back to the person figuring out the features. Further, this form's "person that talks to the engineers" is generally an unfulfilling and disempowering job that often results in either high turnover or people that just show up and do as little as possible. Due to this form there is often an aspect of telephone game issues as all communication of value about the product with the engineers is done through an intermediary. This only enhances the divide between product and engineering. Lastly, in this form engineers are typically forced to stay in their role box unable to directly get customer feedback or contribute to product decisions or solution definition.

## The Absent Product Manager

This form is caused by the Product Manager having multiple jobs in the organization whether it is being the Product Manager for multiple teams or doing some other job unrelated to the product they own. This leads to to teams that are either constantly slowed down waiting to hear back from the Product Manager or that make guesses constantly instead of asking questions. This leads to mistrust as the Product Manager feels the team is not building what they expected and the rest of the team feels the Product Manager is not helping them. This also often leads to slow feedback cycles as the Product Manager is too busy to regularly look at the software the team is building and thus tends to do so only after significant pieces have been built. This only magnifies the pain when the Product Manager realizes the team has not built what they expected.

Often because the Product Manager does not have time to collaborate with the team they are forced to either give only vague information to the team and relinquish most of their responsibilities to them or to engage in waterfall like descriptions of the features expecting the team to deliver on exactly what is specified. This leads to more disenfranchisement, distrust, and unhappy customers as the team fails to deliver valuable features and take into account customer feedback.

## The Way Forward

Many of the pitfalls enumerated above are avoided by having a single person that is the Product Manager. However, it is important that this person not only does their job but works closely with the rest of the team to collaborate on the best solutions. This increases trust and allows the team to feel more ownership which leads to increased satisfaction with work and better products.
