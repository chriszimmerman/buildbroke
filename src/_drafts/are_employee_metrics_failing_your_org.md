title:  "Are Employee Metrics Failing Your Organization?"
categories: agile
---
Empolyee metrics are a very common thing. Particularly as an organization grows it needs ways to both evaluate behavior and to incentivize improving business outcomes. Anyone who has ever experienced having goals set by their employeer and being evaluated in some sort of review process is familar with the idea. However, it has been my experience that this process is rarely done well and that often part of the blame can be placed on the goals and the metrics behind them.

Two of the common problems I have seen are metrics that measure and thus incentize labor for its own sake and metrics that move based on factors that to the employee seem trailing and/or out of their control. The former has been around for ages. Who hasn't heard of or seen someone get kudos for working overtime or weekends. In the later case this is typified by metrics such as company revenue when the employee works on a small peice of a large product and where their work will not see delivery to actuall customers for months after they do it. 

##Labor Promoting Metrics##
In many cases labor promoting metrics may appear at first to be measuring value. For instance in a software development organization you might see metric regarding number of stories completed. However, if you examine this metric you will see that it mearly promotes the creation of widgets as fast as possible with little regard to quality or value to the actual customers. In fact, if it works and inceases the speed at which stories are completed if the organization has not done something to measure the value of those stories then you may very well be producing negative value faster.
