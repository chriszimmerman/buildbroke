I was watching (insert talk link here) and it reminded me of a Bob Martin(aka Uncle Bob) blog post(insert link) that said you should stop everytime a test would fail and do the minimum to make it pass or change the message. One of the things I noticed is that this flow is much more natural in Dynamic languages because there is no distinction to what would be a compiler error in a Static language.
