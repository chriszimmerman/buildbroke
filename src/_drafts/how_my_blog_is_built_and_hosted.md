The last time I setup a blog I just set it up as a Github(tm) pages blog like everyone else. I ended up retiring that blog and as it had been a shared blog I didn't feel comfortable starting it back up.

So, when I went to start this blog I thought about using Github again. Honestly, the only real problem I had with Github pages was the delay you got loading your blog if you had a top level domain maped to it. 

However, it has been a very long time since
