Nick is a software developer and development coach. He currently works at eMoney Advisor, a financial technology company in the Philadelphia area, coaching development teams by helping them learn and improve. He has been working with and advocating for eXtreme Programming for over a decade, especially the developer practices it includes such as pairing and TDD. Lately, he has been thinking a lot about product development and how to create product teams within an organization instead of project teams.
