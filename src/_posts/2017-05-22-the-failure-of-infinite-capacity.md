One of the main principals of agile software development according to the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is that teams will work to continuously deliver valuable software. Further, they will do this by working on and delivering the features and capabilities that provide the greatest value first. Obviously, any understanding of the value a particular feature delivers is a hypothesis based on the current understanding of the Customer's[^1] needs. This fact is what allows teams to continue to make software more valuable without necessarily trailing off because their understanding of the Customer continue to evolve based on feedback and talking to the Customer and the Customer's needs continue to evolve.

However, a common desire from stakeholders and product managers is to get more done faster. This would be fine and dandy except that it is not often accompanied by corresponding increase in feedback and customer development. This means that if the team is always doing the most valuable currently understood things first followed by the next more valuable then the nth thing that the team is working on would at any given moment in time be the least valuable thing they have done.

The result of this is that the longer the list of things a team works on before going back to customers for feedback the lower the average value of each thing. Then since increases in capacity are inevitably associated with hiring more staff costs increase. Even a na√Øve understanding shows that at best case costs will rise linearly with increased capacity[^2]. Therefore, the more capacity the organization has the greater chance they are doing work that is less valuable than the cost of doing it.

Rather than maximize capacity for feature development organizations should strive to balance capacity for development with capacity for feedback and product development. Further, they should recognize that the answer for how to grow the product is not always more software development.

[^1]: In this context Customer stands in for what ever number of people or organizations that your software solves problems or provides value for.
[^2]: Often as has been understood in software development for [years](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489331008&sr=8-1&keywords=mythical+man+month) costs actually rise faster than capacity because each additional staff member increases overhead and thus provides less value than the previous staff member.
